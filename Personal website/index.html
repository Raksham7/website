                            <p>FicZon Inc is an IT solution provider with products ranging from on-premises products to SAAS based solutions. FicZon major leads generation channel is digital and through their website.<hr>
                                FicZon business is majorly dependent on the sales force effectiveness. As the market is maturing and more new competitors are entering the market, FicZon is experiencing a dip in sales. <hr>
                                Effective sales are dependent on lead quality and as of now, this is based on manual categorization and highly dependent on sales staff. Though there is a quality process, which continuously updates the lead categorization, its value is in for post analysis, rather than conversation.<hr>
                                FicZon wants to explore Machine Learning to pre-categorize the lead quality and as result, expecting significant increase in sales effectiveness.<hr>
                                Machine Learning can predict to pre-categorize the lead quality and as result. We are confident this model can help client to increase sales effectiveness. Accuracy of model 100%, we can use Random Forest or XGB Classifier. But for KNN Classifier, we cannot recommend it, because the score is below 100%.

                            <p>Rice is amongst the majorly cultivated crops in India and its leaf diseases can have a substantial impact on output and quality. The most important component is identifying rice leaf diseases, which have a direct impact on the economy and food security. Brown spot, Leaf Smut, Bacteria leaf blight are the most frequently occurring rice leaf diseases. To resolve this issue, we have studied various machine learning and deep learning approaches for detecting diseases on their leaves by calculating their accuracy, recall, and precision to measure the performance. This study helps farmers by detecting diseases in rice leaves in order to get a healthy crop yield.<hr>
                               We discovered that the 5-layer convolutional network performs the best at identifying rice leaves out of all of them. We can conclude that the accuracy of our proposed 5-layer CNN model is approximately 6 percent more than the other standard deep learning models. Also, we observed that by adjusting the training parameters like learning rate, number of epochs, and optimizer methods, we can get significant accuracy with a handmade model having a smaller number of layers than the other traditional models. The better we can detect infections, the simpler it will be for farmers to protect their crops. In the future, we will broaden the scope to include more diseases and algorithms, making disease detection vast, easier and faster.

                            <p>Day by day the cases of heart diseases are increasing at a rapid rate and it's very Important and concerning to predict any such diseases beforehand. This diagnosis is a difficult task i.e., it should be performed precisely and efficiently. The research paper mainly focuses on which patient is more likely to have a heart disease based on various medical attributes. We prepared a heart disease prediction system to predict whether the patient is likely to be diagnosed with a heart disease or not using the medical history of the patient. We used different algorithms of machine learning such as logistic regression and XGBoost, Random Forest to predict and classify the patient with heart disease. A quite Helpful approach was used to regulate how the model can be used to improve the accuracy of prediction of Heart Attack in any individual.<hr>
                                The feature importance graph shows the number of times (f score not f1 score) the XGBoost model splits upon a feature. So, the age was split upon a large amount of time to determine the presence of the CVD.<hr>
                                An XGBoost tree model was used for two reasons:<hr> 
                                1) the model is created by splitting on a specific feature.<hr>
                                2) it’s more robust to other forms of decision tree models.<hr>
                                It has an accuracy of 84%. And confusion matrix as shown in the figure.
